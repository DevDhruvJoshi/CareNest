## Security Posture
- Zero-Trust by default; least privilege for services and networks.
- End-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- Local-only processing; no cloud data exfiltration.

## SSH & Firewall
- Enforce SSH keys only; disable password auth and root login.
- UFW: deny incoming by default, allow 22, explicitly deny 5000 from WAN.
- Fail2Ban enabled with sane retry/bantime.

## Systemd & Services
- Create atomic, idempotent service units.
- Ensure automatic restart and health checks.

## Alerts & Privacy
- Alerts are visual-first and Gujarati-capable; redact sensitive PII in logs.
- Implement face blurring and anonymization where applicable.

## Config Management
- `config.yaml` is source of truth; support env overlays per environment.
- Persist safe defaults for missing fields; document merge order.
