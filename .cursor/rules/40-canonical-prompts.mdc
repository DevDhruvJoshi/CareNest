## Canonical Sources
- `Prompts/IDE_AI_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`
- `Prompts/Prompt.md`

## Usage Policy
- Treat these files as the authoritative specification for scope, features, and deployment.
- When planning or implementing features, align acceptance criteria with the checklists and phases defined in these prompts.
- Prefer local-first, privacy-by-design decisions consistent with these documents.

## Implementation Notes
- Reflect hardware and deployment constraints (Raspberry Pi 4B, UPS, RTSP cameras).
- Enforce non-negotiables (zero-config startup, production readiness, Gujarati-first UX).
- Map tasks to CI/CD, monitoring, and recovery gates specified in `IDE_AI_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`.

## Change Management
- If prompts are updated, re-read and reconcile rules/memories accordingly.
- Record significant technical decisions and conventions in `90-learned-memories.mdc`.
