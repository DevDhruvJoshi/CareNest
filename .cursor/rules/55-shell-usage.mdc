# Shell Usage in CI and Local

- On Windows PowerShell, avoid `&&`; run commands separately.
- Prefer workspace-scoped commands over complex shells:
  - `npm run -w <workspace> <script>`
- Never rely on interactive prompts. Use flags like `--no-audit --no-fund`.
- For long logs in Linux, avoid piping to `cat` in CI; GitHub captures logs already.
- Keep env explicit when needed:
  - `CI=true NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 <command>`
