## Project One-Liner
CareNest Enterprise: 24/7 AI-powered health monitoring ecosystem for an elderly mother with special needs; production-grade, next-day deployable, privacy-first, local-first.

## Non-Negotiables
- Ready-to-use, zero-config startup
- Production quality with CI/CD, monitoring, recovery
- Local processing only (no cloud), privacy-by-design
- Gujarati-first UX for the primary user; Hindi/English optional
- Enterprise security (Zero-Trust, E2E encryption, audit logging)

## Key Capabilities
- RTSP multi-camera ingestion and real-time AI analysis (fall detection, pose, facial indicators)
- Health monitoring: breathing, vitals estimation, posture, sleep, activity timeline
- Multi-channel alerts: SMS, Email, Phone, Push; Gujarati messages
- Web dashboard (mobile-first) with live feeds and real-time status via WebSockets
- Auto-recovery: services, cameras, storage, network; backup/restore

## Target Environments
- Development: Windows 10/11 (PowerShell), Linux, macOS
- Production: Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB), Debian/RPi OS; UPS-backed

## High-Level Structure (expected repository skeleton)
- `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
- `src/` with `core/`, `ai/`, `alerts/`, `web/`, `database/`, `security/`, `monitoring/`, `utils/`, `storage/`
- `templates/`, `static/`, `models/`, `logs/`, `config/`

## Acceptance Gates (must be true)
- Dashboard reachable on localhost:5000 (not WAN-exposed)
- Services managed via systemd/docker; auto-start on boot
- UFW enabled, SSH hardened, Fail2Ban active
- Alerts deliver end-to-end with configured contacts
- Auto-recovery verified (simulated failures)
