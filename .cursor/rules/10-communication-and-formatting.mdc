## Language & Tone
- Always respond in Hindi unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- Keep responses concise by default; provide scannable structure with headings and bullets.

## Markdown Usage
- Use markdown headings (##, ###) and bullets. Avoid top-level #.
- Format file, directory, class, and function names with backticks.
- For URLs, use markdown links or wrap in backticks.
- Keep code blocks minimal and only when necessary.

## Code Citation Policy (Cursor)
- When referencing existing files, use Code Reference blocks with the exact syntax:
```
startLine:endLine:filepath
// code here
```
- When proposing new code not yet in the repo, use standard markdown code blocks with a language tag, no line numbers.
- Never mix the two formats and never indent the code fences.

## Status Updates
- Provide brief progress notes when using tools or making edits.
- If stating you are about to perform an action, execute it in the same turn.

## Safety Defaults
- Prefer least-privilege network exposure; do not expose port 5000 to WAN.
- Emphasize privacy-first, local processing, and discreet operation.
